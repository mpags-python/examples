### Training simple neural networks on the MNIST dataset using keras

A simple example of using keras for supervised learning.

Initially written for the Machine Learning in Astronomy Workshop in Nottingham and significantly expanded for a tutorial at the National Meeting of Data-Intensive Science CDTs in Edinburgh, Nov 2018.

Train some simple fully-connected and convolutional networks on the MNIST dataset, with data augmentation to squeeze out a few more percent accuracy.

`MNIST_demo.ipynb` - bare version

`MNIST_demo_presentation.ipynb` -  version with outputs, extra material and figures

These Jupyter notebooks are set up for presenting with RISE.
